Sqlite-Commander
================

Sqlite-Commander is a project that is aimed to display sqlite databases in Terminal using a ncurses interface. Mono.NCurses is used as the CUI framework. The name is inspired from Midnight-Commander written by Miguel De Icaza.

All the source code is available to you in LGPL v2 only.

Drop me a word if you like the software.


Features
========
+ Shows the list of tables in the left pane
+ Shows the first 30 records for the selected table in the right pane
+ Non-printable columns are shown with a ???
+ Maximum of 30 characters are displayed per column. Column data exceeding this length are shown with "..."


ToDo
====
There are few things which will be good to have. But I don't see a pressing need for these features for my workflow. So I have not implemented these. But patches are more than welcome.
